PHOENIX ADJUDICATION - FIXES REQUIRED SUMMARY
=============================================

Based on your requirements and screenshots, here are the critical issues:

1. THEME - Changed from dark to light ✓
   - Created: assets/css/theme-light.css
   - Created: inc/templates/header_light.php
   - All pages need to switch from header_fixed.php to header_light.php

2. DASHBOARD - Patients table doesn't match screenshot
   Current: Shows patient cards
   Required: Table with columns: Patient ID | Index Drug | Randomisation | Follow-up End | Concomitant Drugs | Actions
   Actions column should have: "OPEN | ADD CONCOMITANT DRUGS" links

3. PATIENT.PHP - Case events table incomplete
   Current: Shows basic table with Outcome, Index Drug, Concomitant Drugs, Action
   Required: Outcome | Category | Source | Mark Absent | Status | Adjudications | Actions
   
   Actions logic:
   - If consensus + 3 adjudications: "Revise | Consensus"
   - If open + has adjudications: "Revise"
   - If open + no adjudications: "Adjudicate"

4. CASE_EVENT.PHP - Critical Issues
   a) Form not saving to database
      - Form posts to ../api/adjudications.php but doesn't work
      - Need to ensure proper field names and submission
   
   b) Missing evidence section
      - Need to show data from dictionary_event table
      - Should display: outcome1-3, caveat1-3, lcat criteria
      - This helps adjudicators make decisions

5. CONSENSUS.PHP - Not working
   - Form doesn't submit properly
   - Need to show existing adjudications
   - Need to show majority preview
   - Redirect after save not working

6. PERMISSIONS - Inconsistent
   - Admin: full access ✓
   - Coordinator: import + consensus ✓
   - Chair: consensus ✓
   - Adjudicator/Reviewer: should be able to adjudicate (currently anyone can)

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
====================

Given context limitations, I recommend:

Option A: I create complete working versions as NEW files
   - patient_working.php
   - case_event_working.php
   - consensus_working.php
   - dashboard_working.php
   
   You test these, then we rename to replace originals

Option B: I fix files one at a time
   - Fix patient.php completely
   - You test
   - Fix case_event.php
   - You test
   - etc.

Option C: I provide you with code snippets
   - You make the changes manually
   - I guide you through each one

Which approach would you prefer?

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS IF YOU WANT ME TO CONTINUE:
================================================

Please confirm:
1. Which files are most critical to fix first?
2. Should I create NEW working files or update existing ones?
3. Do you have test data in the database I should know about?

The fixes are extensive but systematic. I can complete them but need
your guidance on approach given the amount of code involved.
